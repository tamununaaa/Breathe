# Breathe
Breathe is an app designed to help users watch their breath. For centuries, deep breathing has been considered as an important part of meditation practices. Studies 
indicate that regular practice of meditation can reduce anxiety and stress. 
The app uses a simple animated flower that grows and shrinks to let the user relax and watch their breath. ViewAnimator is used to animate the flower with different methods. 
So relax and let your stress go away.
